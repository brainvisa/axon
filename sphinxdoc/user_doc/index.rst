Axon is the glue between the different parts of the `BrainVISA project <http://brainvisa.info>`_. It performs data management, software glue, distributed processing, and offers the main user interface for all software. It is open, and extensible through additional and optional toolboxes.

Axon is the name of the software which runs when you use the ``brainvisa`` command. The latter is still named ``brainvisa`` for historical reasons.
