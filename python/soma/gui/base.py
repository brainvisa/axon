Customizable framework for automatic creation of

L{soma.signature} module but it can be used in many other contexts.

        Ensure that the module defining the L{GUI} derived class associated with
        class C{cls} has been loaded. The name of a L{GUI} derived class
        associated to a class C{C} is always the name of {C} postfixed with
        C{'_GUI'}. For instance, C{class MyClass( object ):} is associated to
        C{class MyClass_GUI( GUI ):}. This function look into several modules
        (eventually loading them) to find a L{GUI} derived class with the
        appropriate name:
          - In the module where class C{cls} has been defined. Let's call this
            module the class module.
          - In a module named as the class module with C{'_gui'} postfix and
            defined in a C{gui} directory located in the same directory as the
            class module.
          - In a module named as the class module with C{'_gui'} postfix and
            defined in a C{gui} directory located in the parent directory of the
            class module.

        Example:
          If a class C{TestClass} has been defined in /home/me/python/tests/test_class.py, if a class C{TestClass_GUI} is defined.
